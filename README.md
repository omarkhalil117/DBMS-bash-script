# Bash-Base Database Management System (DBMS):

The project's objective is to create a Database Management System (DBMS) on RHEL9(Plow) Distro that facilitates users in storing and retrieving data stored on a hard disk.
The main features of the project include the development of a Command Line Interface (CLI) menu-based application. This application will offer various menu options accessible to users:

Main Menu:
* Creating a new database
* Displaying a list of existing databases
* Connecting to databases
* Deleting a database
  
Once a user connects to a specific database, a new interface will be presented, offering a different set of menu options:   

* Creating a new table within the connected database
* Displaying a list of tables in the connected database
* Deleting a table from the connected database
* Inserting data into a table
* Retrieving/selecting data from a table
* Removing data from a table
* Updating existing data within a table
